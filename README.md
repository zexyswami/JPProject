#OOP Project

This project was a test of all the functionality and lessons shown in class. This was an independent project done by all students in alike. The project began in late August early September 2018 and finished by December 10th, 2018. This assignment was a good practice to see the lessons learned in class used optimally in a program that was fairly practical. The class this was made in was COP 3003 object oriented programming at Florida Gulf Coast University.

##Getting Started

This program does not have a runnable jar and inputs are hard coded, the only class that can take input from user is the EmployeeInfo class, and I have not implemented a main function to implement it's functionality yet. you can only download the src file and open code in intellij, eclipse or any java editor you possess.

##Built With

Intellij:
Version: 2018.3.1
Build: 183.4588.61
plugins helped clean up any errors or bugs in written code and had comprehendable github functionality
