#Project Title
This project was a test of all the functionality and lessons shown in class. This was an independent project done by all students in alike. The project began in late August early September 2018 and finished by December 10th, 2018. This assignment was a good practice to see the lessons learned in class used optimally in a program that was fairly practical. The class this was made in was COP 3003 object oriented programming at Florida Gulf Coast University.
